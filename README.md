## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how `display: flex;` works!

```
h1 {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

This will display the h1 in the center of the screen!

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for to understand how Flexbox works. I really liked how they explained everything about it and will use it going forward.
